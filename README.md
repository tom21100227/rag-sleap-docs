# rag-sleap-docs
Do retrieval augmented generation on docs for sleap and sleap-io. 

TODO: 
- Handle Multiple User (currenly everyone shares the same chat history)
- Handle chat history better (Right now the raw json dump is used)
- Better newcomer experience (Default to RAG Fusion, Default to turn off RAG after first conversation. )
- Option to switch to a better LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro).
